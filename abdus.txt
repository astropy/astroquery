This is a clever way of speeding up the query.
d- position should be str or SkyCoord to match query_region
d- times should be in astropy.time.Times to give the user flexibility
x- Add radius option. None should use the default a.dsr values. If given, it should be used, and this should override the dec constraints?
[I disagree]
x- add_offset to give distance to the searched coordinate in arcmin simialr to query_regoin.
[I don't understand.  Can't have an offset for 100 matches.]
d- Several linting issues.
- Testing should use get_query_payload for offline testing, and add remote tests in test_heasarc_remote.py. The tests need to filter the results (avoid active tables) so the results are reproducible.
d- There is a pending PR that was submitted a few weeks ago, that can be used to simplify the code in query_all by reducing duplication.
