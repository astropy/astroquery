Astroquery
==========

This is the documentation for the Astroquery coordinated package of `astropy
<https://www.astropy.org>`__.

Code and issue tracker are on `GitHub <https://github.com/astropy/astroquery>`_.

If you use astroquery, please `cite <https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/blob/main/astroquery/CITATION>`__ the
paper `Ginsburg, Sip≈ëcz, Brasseur et al 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157...98G/abstract>`_.

Introduction
------------

Astroquery is a set of tools for querying astronomical web forms and databases.

There are two other packages with complimentary functionality as Astroquery:
`pyvo <https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is an Astropy affiliated package, and
`Simple-Cone-Search-Creator <https://github.com/tboch/Simple-Cone-Search-Creator/>`_ to
generate a cone search service complying with the
`IVOA standard <http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ConeSearch.html>`_.
They are more oriented to general `virtual observatory <http://www.virtualobservatory.org>`_
discovery and queries, whereas Astroquery has web service specific interfaces.


Installation
------------

Uniquely in the Astropy ecosystem, Astroquery is operating with a **continuous deployment model**.
It means that a release is instantaneously available after a pull request has been merged. These
releases are automatically uploaded to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/astroquery/#history>`__,
and therefore the latest version of astroquery can be pip installed.
The version number of these automated releases contain the ``'dev'`` tag, thus pip needs to be told
to look for these releases during an upgrade, using the ``--pre`` install option. If astroquery is
already installed, please make sure you use the ``--upgrade`` (or ``-U``) install option as well.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install -U --pre astroquery

To install all the mandatory and optional dependencies add the ``[all]``
identifyer to the pip command above (or use ``[docs]`` or ``[test]`` for the
dependencies required to build the documentation or run the tests):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install -U --pre astroquery[all]

In addition to the automated releases, we also keep doing regular, tagged version for maintenance
and packaging purposes. These can be ``pip`` installed without the ``--pre`` option and
are also available from the ``conda-forge`` conda channel.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge astroquery

To review recent changes and fixes, please have a look at the changelog:

Building from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development version can be obtained and installed from github:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ # If you have a github account:
    $ git clone git@github.com:astropy/astroquery.git
    $ # If you do not:
    $ git clone https://github.com/astropy/astroquery.git
    $ cd astroquery
    $ python -m pip install .


To install all the optional dependencies (listed below), add the option
``[all]``. To install dependencies required for running the tests locally
use ``[test]``, and for documentation build ``[docs]``.
If you would like to modify the source, you can install
``astroquery`` in editable mode, which means you don't need to rerun the
install command after you made the changes.

To install all dependencies, including those required for local testing and
building the documentation, in editable mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install -e .[all,test,docs]

Using astroquery
----------------

All astroquery modules are supposed to follow the same API.  In its simplest form, the API involves
queries based on coordinates or object names.  Some simple examples, using SIMBAD:

.. doctest-remote-data::

    >>> from astroquery.simbad import Simbad
    >>> result_table = Simbad.query_object("m1")
    >>> result_table.pprint()

    main_id    ra     dec   coo_err_maj coo_err_min coo_err_angle coo_wavelength     coo_bibcode     matched_id
              deg     deg       mas         mas          deg
    ------- ------- ------- ----------- ----------- ------------- -------------- ------------------- ----------
      M   1 83.6324 22.0174      5000.0      5000.0            90              X 2022A&A...661A..38P      M   1

All query tools allow coordinate-based queries:

.. doctest-remote-data::

    >>> from astropy import coordinates
    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> c = coordinates.SkyCoord("05h35m17.3s -05d23m28s", frame='icrs')
    >>> r = 5 * u.arcminute
    >>> result_table = Simbad.query_region(c, radius=r)
    >>> result_table.pprint(show_unit=True, max_width=80, max_lines=5)
              main_id                  ra       ...     coo_bibcode
                                      deg       ...

.. _astroquery_cache:

Caching
-------

By default Astroquery employs query caching with a timeout of 1 week.
The user can clear their cache at any time, as well as suspend cache usage,
and change the cache location. Caching persists between Astroquery sessions.
If you know the service you are using has released new data recently, or if you believe you are
not receiving the newest data, try clearing the cache.

Service specific settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Astroquery cache location is specific to individual services,
so each service's cache should be managed individually.
The cache location can be viewed with the following command
(using :ref:`VizieR <astroquery.vizier>` as an example):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astroquery.vizier import Vizier
    >>> print(Vizier.cache_location)   # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    /Users/username/.astropy/cache/astroquery/Vizier

Each service's cache is cleared with the ``clear_cache`` function within that service.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import os
    >>> from astroquery.vizier import Vizier
    ...
    >>> os.listdir(Vizier.cache_location)   # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    ['8abafe54f49661237bdbc2707179df53b6ee0d74ca6b7679c0e4fac0.pickle',
    '0e4766a7673ddfa4adaee2cfa27a924ed906badbfae8cc4a4a04256c.pickle']
    >>> Vizier.clear_cache()
    >>> os.listdir(Vizier.cache_location)   # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    []

Astroquery-wide settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether caching is active and when cached files expire are controlled centrally through the
astroquery ``cache_conf`` module, and shared among all services.
Astroquery uses the Astropy configuration infrastructure, information about
temporarily or permanently changing configuration values can be found
`here <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/config/index.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery import cache_conf
  ...
  >>> # Is the cache active?
  >>> print(cache_conf.cache_active)
  True
  >>> # Cache timout in seconds
  >>> print(cache_conf.cache_timeout)

each source (though they may return many catalogs that *each* have one row
for each source)

Developer documentation
-----------------------

The modules and their maintainers are listed on the
`Maintainers <https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/wiki/Maintainers>`_
wiki page.


The :doc:`api` is intended to be kept as consistent as possible, such
that any web service can be used with a minimal learning curve imposed on the
user.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   api.rst
   template.rst
   testing.rst

The following Astroquery modules are mostly meant for internal use of
services in Astroquery, you can use them for your scripts, but we don't guarantee API stability.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  utils.rst
  query.rst
  utils/tap.rst

To debug astroquery, logging level can be configured with the following:

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> from astroquery import log
    >>> log.setLevel(level)

If ``level`` is set to ``"DEBUG"``, then HTTP requests are logged.
If ``level`` is set to ``"TRACE"``, then HTTP requests and responses are logged.
