#    All Gaia data processed by the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium
#    comes tagged with a solution identifier. This is a numeric field
#    attached to each table row that can be used to unequivocally identify
#    the version of all the subsystems that where used in the generation of
#    the data as well as the input data used. It is mainly for internal DPAC
#    use but is included in the published data releases to enable end users
#    to examine the provenance of processed data products. To decode a given
#    solution ID visit

#    A unique single numerical identifier of the source.
#    
#    For the contents of Gaia DR1, which does not include Solar System
#    objects, the source ID consists consists of a 64-bit integer, least
#    significant bit = 1 and most significant bit = 64, comprising:
#    
#    -   a HEALPix index number (sky pixel) in bits 36 - 63; by definition
#        the smallest HEALPix index number is zero.
#    
#    -   a 2-bit Data Processing Centre code in bits 34 - 35; for example
#        MOD(sourceId / 4294967296, 8) can be used to distinguish between
#        sources initialised via the Initial Gaia Source List by the Torino
#        DPC (code = 0) and sources otherwise detected and assigned by Gaia
#        observations (code?>0)
#    
#    -   a 25-bit plus 7 bit sequence number within the HEALPix pixel in bits
#        1 - 32 split into:
#    
#        -   a 25 bit running number in bits 8 ? 32; the running numbers are
#            defined to be positive, i.e.?never zero (except in the case of
#            forced empty windows)
#    
#        -   a 7-bit component number in bits 1 ? 7
#    
#    -   one spare bit in bit 33
#    
#    This means that the HEALpix index level 12 of a given source is
#    contained in the most significant bits. HEALpix index of 12 and lower
#    levels can thus be retrieved as follows:
#    
#    -   HEALpix level 12 = source_id / 34359738368
#    
#    -   HEALpix level 11 = source_id / 137438953472
#    
#    -   HEALpix level 10 = source_id / 549755813888
#    
#    -   HEALpix level n = source_id / 2 ^ 35 * 4 ^ (12 - level).
