Studies of water in star forming regions show that it is the most abundant molecule in the surface ices on dust grains (e.g., Gibb et al. 2004), an important coolant (e.g., Watson et al. 2007), and thus, highly influential for the oxygen based chemistry (e.g., van Dishoeck & Blake 1998). The water is locked up as ice on grains in cold and shielded regions, but close to the forming protostar, where the temperature reaches 90 \u0303100 K, water ice evaporates from the grains, raising its abundance in the gas-phase. Exactly which mechanism that regulates when and where this happens is still debated. In the poster we will present high-angular resolution (\u03030.7\'\'), ground based interferometric observations of an isotopologue of water toward the four low-mass protostars NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, IRAS 4A (NW & SE), and IRAS 4B. Watson et al. (2007) detected mid-IR water emission towards IRAS 4B with the Spitzer Space Telescope - but not the other Class 0 sources. Here the maps show compact emission stemming from the inner 100 AU in all of the sources, except IRAS 4A-SE. Although properties (mass, luminosity, age) are similar for the sources, we detect large differences in relative abundances between water and complex organic molecules in the spatially resolved emission. One source, IRAS 2A, show water emission in the outflow close to the protostar.","page":["295"],"bibcode":"2011IAUS..280P.295P","pubdate":"2011-05-00","author":["Persson, M. V.","Jorgensen, J.
