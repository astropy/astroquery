It consists of a set of 355,220,325 point sources detected by the DENIS survey in 3662 strips (covering each 30 degrees in declination and 12 arcmin in right ascension). The data in this release cover approximately 16700 square degrees of the Southern sky. Multiple detections of single point sources have been merged in image overlaps within individual strips, but sources can have multiple detections in overlaping strips. DENIS is the only astronomical survey of the Southern sky made in two near-infrared bands (J at 1.25{mu}m, and K_s_ at 2.15{mu}m) and one optical band (Gunn-i at 0.82{mu}m), with limiting magnitudes 16.5, 14 and 18.5, respectively. Saturation magnitudes are K_s_=6, J=7.5 and Gunn-i=9.8mag. It was conducted by a European consortium, using the 1m telescope at ESO, La Silla (Chile). The DENIS instrument is made up of a 3-channel camera built of commercially available detector arrays by the Observatoire de Paris and with major contributions from other European Institutes, notably: the IAS in Frascati, the Observatoire de Grenoble, the University of Innsbruck, the Observatoire de Lyon, and the IAC in Tenerife. The survey is carried out by observing strips of 30{deg} in declination and 12arcminutes in Right Ascension with an overlap of 2 arcminutes between consecutive strips. The survey started at the end of 1995 and has been completed up to 97% in 2001. The data have been reduced at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris and Observatoire de Paris. The position of a general extracted point source is provided with an accuracy better than 1arcsec and its magnitude to better than 0.1 mag. The Centre de Donnees Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) is releasing the final databases and provides access of the processed and calibrated data to the worldwide community. The principal investigator of the DENIS project is N. Epchtein (Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur); the Co-PI in charge of data processing is G. Simon (observatoire de Paris); J. Borsenberger and B. de Batz, with the help of F. Tanguy, S. Begon and P. Texier, processed the data and implemented the working data base at PDAC; S. Derriere is in charge of the data release at CDS. Scientists and engineers from seven European countries and from Brazil are involved in the data qualification and analysis.</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/sai_cas/conesearch?cat=denis&amp;amp;tab=main&amp;amp;</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/cas/</TD><TD>Sternberg Astronomical Institute Virtual Observatory Project</TD><TD>conesearch</TD></TR><TR><TD /><TD>gsc1_2</TD><TD>ivo://astronet.ru/cas/gsc1_2</TD><TD>The Guide Star Catalog (GSC), which has been constructed to support the operational need of the Hubble Space Telescope contains nearly 19 million objects brighter than sixteenth magnitude, of which more than 15 million are classified as stars.

The almost 100 GB dataset contains astrometric and photometric data for about 1.1 billion stars derived from the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, UCAC2, Yellow-Blue 6, and USNO-B catalogs for astrometry and optical photometry, supplemented by 2MASS near-infrared photometry. For each unique star the "best" astrometric and photometric data are chosen from the source catalogs and merged into a single dataset. A sequence of priorities is followed and NOMAD contains flags to identify the source catalogs and gives cross-reference identifications. This first release of NOMAD is not a compiled catalog; that is, if a star is identified in more than 1 of the above mentioned catalogs, only 1 catalog entry is chosen. Thus the local and global systematic errors of the various source catalogs will be present in this version of NOMAD. All source catalogs astrometric data are on the International Celestial Reference System within the limitations of the source catalogs. Catalogs used: Hipparcos Catalogue: Positions, proper motions and errors are used; however, no parallaxes are included in NOMAD. Tycho-2: is a compiled catalog with proper motions derived from the combination of Hipparcos satellite measures (mainly its star tracker data) and over 100 ground-based astrometric catalogs which provided the early epoch data. Most of the Tycho B and V magnitudes (which includes Hipparcos stars) went into NOMAD as well. UCAC2: is also a compiled catalog, including all catalogs used for Tycho-2 (thus also including Tycho and Hipparcos astrometric data), plus the recent epoch ground-based observations of the UCAC project. However, only 86\% of the sky are covered by UCAC2 (the north celestial pole area is missing). For stars not in USNO-B, the UCAC2 magnitude has been used as "R" photometry value, although the UCAC2 bandpass is between V and R. YB6: (Yellow-Blue catalog version 6) is unpublished data obtained from complete scans of the NPM and SPM plates performed on the PMM at USNO, Flagstaff Station. The limiting magnitude is about 18 and YB6 is the major source of faint B and V magnitudes in NOMAD. 2MASS: the near IR photometry without errors or flags has been copied into NOMAD. For those stars without optical counterparts, the 2MASS astrometric information was used (no proper motions). USNO-B: provides positions and proper motions for most faint stars in NOMAD. Most R photometry in NOMAD comes from this catalog. For more details, see the catalog introductions for each individual catalog used in NOMAD. NOMAD is not a compiled catalog, no average values are taken if a star appears in more than 1 source catalog. Each astrometric and photometric entry in NOMAD is taken from a specific source catalog. The priority order is as follows: astrometry brighter than 8 mag: Hipparcos Tycho-2 UCAC2 astrometry of fainter stars: Hipparcos UCAC2 Tycho-2 USNO-B YB6 2MASS photometry: optical Tycho-2 (incl. Hipparcos stars) YB6 USNO-B UCAC2 photometry: near IR 2MASS</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/sai_cas/conesearch?cat=nomad&amp;amp;tab=main&amp;amp;</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/cas/</TD><TD>Sternberg Astronomical Institute Virtual Observatory Project</TD><TD>conesearch</TD></TR><TR><TD /><TD>sdssdr5-photoobj</TD><TD>ivo://astronet.ru/cas/sdssdr5-photoobjall</TD><TD>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a project to survey a 10000 square degree area on the Northern sky over a 5 year period.

In addition to providing a context for the interpretation of results obtained at infrared and other wavelengths, 2MASS will provide direct answers to immediate questions on the large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the Local Universe. To achieve these goals, 2MASS is uniformly scanning the entire sky in three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10, using a pixel size of 2.0". This will achieve an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS uses two new, highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope is equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256x256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 {mu}m), H (1.65 {mu}m), and Ks (2.17 {mu}m), to a 3{sigma} limiting sensitivity of 17.1, 16.4 and 15.3mag in the three bands. The 2MASS arrays image the sky while the telescopes scan smoothly in declination at a rate of ~1' per second. The 2MASS data "tiles" are 6 deg. long in the declination direction and one camera frame (8.5') wide. The camera field-of-view shifts by ~1/6 of a frame in declination from frame-to-frame. The camera images each point on the sky six times for a total integration time of 7.8 s, with sub-pixel "dithering", which improves the ultimate spatial resolution of the final Atlas Images.

The UCAC2 is a high density, highly accurate, astrometric catalog of 48,330,571 stars covering the sky from -90 to +40 degrees in declination and going up to +52 degrees in some areas. The northern limit is a function of right ascension. Proper motions and photometry are provided for all stars. Positions and proper motions are on the ICRS (International Celestial Reference System) and given at the epoch J2000.0. The UCAC2 has a number of major differences with respect to UCAC1. These differences include: - much larger sky coverage - reduced systematic errors of CCD observations - positions given at a standard epoch (J2000.0) - the addition of several new catalogs for improved proper motions - photometry in the J, H, and K_s bands from the 2MASS project - data in binary format for direct access - inclusion of software to aid users in quick access of the data Additional details of the data are found in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this document.</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/sai_cas/conesearch?cat=ucac2&amp;amp;tab=main&amp;amp;</TD><TD>http://vo.astronet.ru/cas/</TD><TD>Sternberg Astronomical Institute Virtual Observatory Project</TD><TD>conesearch</TD></TR><TR><TD /><TD>ucac3</TD><TD>ivo://astronet.ru/cas/ucac3</TD><TD>UCAC3 is a compiled, all-sky star catalog covering mainly the 8 to 16 magnitude range in a single bandpass between V and R. Positional errors are about 15 to 20 mas for stars in the 10 to 14 mag range. It is supplemented by proper motions and SuperCosmos and 2MASS photometric data, as well as various flags. The proper motions of bright stars are based on about 140 catalogs, including Hipparcos and Tycho, as well as all catalogs used for the Tycho-2 proper motion construction. Proper motions of faint stars are based on a re-reduction of early epoch SPM data (-90 to -10 deg Dec) plus Schmidt plate data from the SuperCosmos project (down weighted due to systematic errors of order 100 mas). The proper motions of faint stars (R &amp;lt;= 13.5) therefore should be used with caution. The unpublished plate measure data from the AGK2, the Hamburg Zone Astrograph, the USNO Black Birch Astrograph, and the Lick Astrograph have considerably contributed to improve proper motions for stars mainly in the 10 to 14 mag range (down to the UCAC3 limit for Lick data); however, these data do not cover all sky. UCAC3 features a number of major differences with respect to UCAC2: - complete sky coverage - re-reduction of the pixel data with better modeling - double stars are resolved to the limit of the data - significantly improved photometry from CCD data - slightly deeper limiting magnitude with larger number of stars/area - reduced systematic errors of CCD observations - the addition of several new catalogs for improved proper motions - photometry in the B, R, and I bands from the SuperCosmos project - minor planet observations have been sorted out - identification of more high proper motion stars - match with 2MASS extended sources and LEDA galaxies Additional details will be published in the upcoming release paper (Zacharias et al. 2009) and in several technical papers describing details of the reduction procedures and results.
