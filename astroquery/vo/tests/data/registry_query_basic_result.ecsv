x-ray RXTE ivo://nasa.heasarc/skyview/rxte "Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer was launched at the end of 1995 and up to now (2004) it has been successfully operating for more than 7 years. The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &lt;p&gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the 'flux' units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role. Details of the survey are presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al.

x-ray RASSBCK ivo://nasa.heasarc/skyview/rassbck "These maps present maps of ROSAT soft X-ray all-sky survey as presented in Snowden et al, ApJ 485, 125 (1997).

Only data within a single NEAT image will be displayed. The system attempts to find the most recent image within which has a offset in both RA and Dec of less than 0.8 degrees. If no such image is found, then an image with the minimum offset is returned, or the search may fail altogether if there are no nearby plates. The NEAT telescope uses an array of 4 CCDs. The backgrounds of the CCDs may differ significantly. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The NEAT survey covers approximately 30% of the sky. Extreme southern and low-Galactic latitude regions are unsurveyed. Coverage is otherwise particularly dense in the ecliptic plane. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; NEAT data consists primarily of groups of three images taken with separations of 20 minutes and almost identical positions. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; SkyView &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; will normally return the last of a 'triplet'. The SkyMorph site can be used to display an overlay of triplets to look for targets which moved during the interval between images. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A catalog of objects detected in the NEAT/SkyMorph pages is accessible through the SkyMorph pages. 'Light-curves' from all images during which an object was in the NEAT field of view can also be generated. &amp;lt;P&amp;gt; The NEAT data values are in arbitrary density units.

The highest resolution pixels (HEALPix order 17) have a size of roughly 1.6"". Data are also stored at lower resolutions at factors of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32, and in an all sky image with a resolution 1/256 of the higest resolution. An intensity map has been created as the ratio of the counts and exposure maps. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; These surveys combine the basic count and exposure maps provided as standard products in the Swift XRT archive in obsid/xrt/products/*xpc_(sk|ex).img.gz. The surveys were created as follows: &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All of the exposure maps available in the archive in mid-May 2017 were combined using the CDS-developed Hipsgen tool. This includes 129,063 observations for which both count and exposure files were found in PC mode. Three exposures where there was a counts map but no exposure map were ignored. A few exposure files had more than one exposure extension. 1,082 files had two extensions and 1 file had 3 extensions. The 1084 HDUs in extensions were extracted as separate files and included in the total exposure. The value of 0 was given to the Hipsgen software as the null value for the FITS files. This caused the CDS software to treat such pixels as missing rather than 0 exposure. &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; The counts data was extracted from the counts maps for each observation using &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; developed software. For any pixel in which a count was recorded, the corresponding exposure file was checked and if there was any exposure (in any of the associated extensions), then the count was retained. If there was no exposure in any of the extensions of the corresponding exposure file, the counts in the pixel were omitted. Once a count was accepted, the overlap between the counts map pixel and the pixels of the corresponding HiPS tile (or tiles) was computed. Each count was then assigned entirely to a single pixel in the HiPS tile randomly but with the destination pixel probabilities weighted by area of the overlap. Thus if several pixels were found in a given counts map pixel they might be assigned to different pixels in the output image. The HiPS pixels (~1.6"") used were of substantially higher resolution than the XRT resolution of 18"" and somewhat higher than the counts map resolution of 2.36"". &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A total of 183,750,428 photons were extracted from the counts maps while 15,226 were rejected as being from pixels with 0 exposure. There were 501 pixels which required special treatment as straddling the boundaries of the HEALPix projection. &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; The resulting counts tiles were then clipped using the exposure tiles that had been previously generated. Basically this transferred the coverage of the exposure tiles to the counts tiles. Any counts pixel where the corresponding exposure pixel was a NaN was changed to a NaN to indicate that there was no coverage in this region. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; During the clipping process 137,730 HiPS level 8 were clipped (of 786,432 over the entire sky). There were 12,236 tiles for which there was some exposure but no counts found. During the clipping process 2 photons were found on pixels where there was no corresponding exposure in the exposure tiles. This can happen when the pixel assignment process noted above shifts a photon just outside the exposed region but should be -- as it was -- rare. These photons were deleted. &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; After creating the clipped level 8 counts maps, level 7 to 3 tiles and an all sky map where generated by averaging pixels 2x2 to decrease each level. When adding the four pixels in the level N map together only pixels whose value was not NaN were considered. &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; Finally an intensity map was created by dividing the counts tiles by the exposure tiles. To eliminate gross fluctuations due to rare counts in regions with very low exposure, only regions with exposure &amp;gt; 1 second were retained. A total of 30 photons were deleted due to this criterion. &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Note that while any sampler may in principle be used with these data, the Spline sampler may give unexpected results. The spline computation propogates NaNs thought the image and means that even occasional NaNs can corrupt the output image completely. NaNs are very common in this dataset. Also, if the region straddles a boundary in the HEALPix projection, the size of the requested input region is likely to exceed memory limits since the HiPS data are considered a single very large image." https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=swiftxrt&amp; https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov "NASA/GSFC HEASARC" simpleimageaccess

In our Web interface only the SNR surveys are shown in the Web form. Users can get flux maps corresponding to a given SNR image from the results pages. The batch interfaces may directly query any of the surveys since the user chooses the names explicitly rather than from a selection box. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The values displayed in the significance maps are the local signal to noise ratio in each pixel. The noise in these coded-mask images follows a Gaussian distribution with center at zero and a characteristic width (sigma) of 1.0. The noise is calculated locally for each pixel by measuring the RMS value of all pixel values in an annulus around each pixel and hence includs both statistical and systematic components. Known sources are excluded from the annuli. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The signal in each pixel is taken from the flux maps. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The flux values are in the native BAT survey units of counts/sec/detector.

If you wish access to the older data please let us know. Note that for the 9-month data we provided access through the web page to the flux data and gave links to the signal-to-noise maps. Since the existence of sources is most easily seen in the SNR maps, we decided to invert that for this release. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; For the 8 band data, the source data were provided by the BAT team as 6 FITS files. Each of these contained the 8 bands in separate image extensions for a region centered at l=0,b=+/-90 or l=0,90,180,270,b=0, the centers of 6 cubic facets. However these data are not the classical cube-faced projections, e.g., as used in COBE data. The data on the facets overlap, so that this is just a convenient way to tile the sky. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; separated each of the FITS image extensions into a separate file, but no other modifications were made to the data.

IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point sources and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness.

Using an SBIG STL-11000 camera, 70 fields (each covering 40x27 degrees) were imaged from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas and Michigan. In order to increase the dynamic range beyond the 16 bits of the camera's analog-to-digital converter (of which approximately 12 bits provide data above the noise leve) three different exposure times (240s, 15s and 0.5 s) were used. Five frames were taken for each exposure time and filter setting. The frames were photometrically calibrated using standard catalog stars and sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes. the panorama has an image scale of 36""/pixel and a limiting magnitude of approximately 14. The survey has an 18 bit dynamic range. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The processing of these data used a custom data pipeline built using IRAF, Source Extractor and SWarp. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The data used here were converted to three independent RGB color planes of 8 bits each and provided to SkyView as a single 36000x18000x3 Cartesian projection cube. To allow users to efficiently sample data in a region of the sky, this cube was broken up into 2100x2100 pixel regions with a 50 pixel overlap between adjacent images. Tiles at the poles were 2100x2050. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; each color plane comprises a survey. The individual planes may be sampled as surveys independently as Mellinger-R, Mellinger-G and Mellinger-B. The color mosaics can be regenerated by creating an RGB image of all three surveys. Since &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; may stretch the intensity values within each color, linear scaling and a minimum of 0 and maximum of 255 should be specified to keep the original intensity scalings. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The full spatial resolution data is used for images of less than 30 degrees on a side. If a user requests a larger region, data are sampled from a lower resolution 3600x1800x3 data cube. Please contact the survey author if you need to use the higher resolution data for larger regions.

In these cases the source appears fuzzy due to the poor resolution of ROSAT near the edge of the field of view. This comes at the cost of a substantial reduction in the fraction of the sky covered. Counts and exposure maps are included for users who may need this information (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;e.g.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, to do statistical analysis). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The global organization of the surveys is similar to the IRAS survey.

Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, the automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, good quality images were created for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. This data release covers 36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90 deg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images have a background RMS noise below 5 mJy/beam with an approximate resolution of 25"" x 25"" (or 25"" x 25"" / cos (DEC - 19 deg) for pointings south of 19 deg DEC). The associated catalog has 640 thousand radio sources derived from an initial, high reliability source extraction at the 7 sigma level. The measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2"" in RA and DEC, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at ~10 percent.

Data from the four IRAS bands are shown as individual surveys in SkyView. Users should be aware that IPAC does not encourage the use of data near the ecliptic plane as they feel that contribution from local cirrus emission is significant. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The data are distributed in sets of 430 maps. Each map covers approximately 12.5x12.5 degrees, and the map centers are offset by 5 degrees so that there is a 2.5 degree overlap. IPAC has processed to a uniform standard so that excellent mosaics of the maps can be made. Users should be cautious of data in saturated regions. Known problems in the analysis mean that data values are unlikely to be correct. Note that IPAC has optimized the processing of these data for features of 5' or more although the resolution of the data is closer to the 1.5' pixel size. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There are occasional pixels in the IRAS maps which are given as NULL values. Unless these are explicitly trapped by user software, these data will appear as large negative values. SkyView ignores these pixels when determining the color scale to display an image. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Essentially the entire sky is covered by the survey.

uv#optical SWIFTUVOT ivo://nasa.heasarc/skyview/swiftuvot "The Swift UVOT instrument is a 30 cm modified Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope launched on board the Swift satellite on November 20, 2004. The range of optical and UV filters can accomodate wavebands between 1700 and 6500 Angstroms. A full field image covers 17x17 arcminutes and at maximum spatial sampling is imaged onto 2048x2048 0.5"" pixels. A 1000 second observation can detect point sources to m=22.3 when no filter is used. The Swift Serendipitous Source Catalog (Page et al., 2015) detects sources down to m=23-26 for the six filters in very deep observations, but the typical limits are substantially brighter (~20-23 magnitude). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; These surveys are mosaics of all Swift UVOT observations released between the start of the mission and July 2017. Data were extracted from the HEASARC archive from the UVOT products directory. Mosaics are provided in six filters and also with no filter, i.e., WHITE. The table below gives the number of observations and bandpasses for each of the filters. For each UVOT observation standard processing generates a counts and exposure file as a single multi-extension FITS file with a separate extension for each filter. To aid processing, these extensions were copied into separate files in directory trees for each filter. Four observations in which the exposure and counts maps did not agree on the filters used were omitted from the processing. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Some observations were recorded with 0.5"" pixels while others were binned to 1"". All 0.5"" observations (typically fewer than 10%) were rebinned to the larger pixels for the counts maps since the counts data scales with the pixel size. Since the exposure values are intensive and do not vary significantly based upon the resolution, these data were not generally rebinned unless it was needed to ensure that Order 9 Hips data were produced. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The CDS Hipsgen software was used to generate Order 9 HiPS data (~0.8"" pixels) for both the Counts and Exposure images. The HiPS (Hierarchical Progressive Survey VO standard) supports multi-resolution mosaics. Any quantitative use of these images should note that the rebinning increases the total counts by a factor of ~(1.0/0.8)^2 ~ 1.56. This software uses a bilinear interpolation to generate HEALPix tiles of an appropriate order (18 in this case). &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; developed software was used to divide the level 9 counts maps tiles by the corresponding exposure maps to create intensity tiles. Pixels where the exposure was less than 5 seconds were left as NaNs. The lower order (8 to 3) order intensity tiles were then generated by averaging 2x2 sets of the higher order maps treating any missing maps or pixels as NaNs. A HiPS all-sky image was generated by averaged the Order 3 tiles. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Only the Intensity HIPS files are presented in the SkyView web page directly, but intensity, counts and exposure maps are available for all seven filters. Note that unlike the XRT HiPS data, the exposure and counts maps have not been clipped. I.e., the source FITS files have been aligned with the coordinate system and thus contain large numbers of unexposed pixels with 0 values. These 0's are simply propogated to HiPS tiles. NaNs are returned in regions which lie outside any of the original source images. For the Intensity map, any pixel for which the exposure was less than 5s is returned as a NaN. &amp;lt;table border&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;Filter&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Count&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Central Wavelength (&amp;amp;amp;#8491;;)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Bandpass (&amp;amp;amp;#8491;;)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Central Frequency(THz)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Bandpass (THz)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Coverage&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;WHITE&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;3,000&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;3600&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1600-6000&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;832&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;500-1874&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0017&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;V&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;30,557&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;5468&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;5083-5852&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;548&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;512-590&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0171&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;28,347&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;4392&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;3904-4880&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;683&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;614-768&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0112&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;U&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;49,954&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;3465&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;3072-3875&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;865&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;774-975&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0287&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;UVW1&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;60,690&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;2600&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;2253-2946&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1154&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1017-1330&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0277&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;UVM2&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;56,977&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;2246&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1997-2495&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1334&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1201-1501&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;gt;td&amp;gt;0.0314&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th align=center&amp;gt;UVW2&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;54,590&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1928&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1600-2256&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1554&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td align='center'&amp;gt;1328-1874&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0.0260&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/table&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Observation counts and bandpasses for UVOT Filters&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;" https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=swiftuvot&amp; https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov "NASA/GSFC HEASARC" simpleimageaccess

x-ray GRANAT ivo://nasa.heasarc/skyview/granat "The Soviet orbital observatory GRANAT was launched in December 1989 and was operational till November 1998. One of the main instruments of the observatory was the French-Soviet hard X-ray coded mask telescope SIGMA (Paul et al.1 1991, Adv.Space Res., 11, 279). It was the first space telescope that used coded aperture technique for reconstruction of sky images in hard X-rays (35-1300 keV). The angular resolution of the telescope was approximately 12' and the accuracy of a source localization is approximately 2-3'.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; SIGMA discovered numerous interesting hard X-ray sources including GRS 1758-258, which is located only 40' from bright soft X-ray source GX 5-1. It detected hard X-ray flux from X-ray burster A1742-294, which is very near to bright black hole binary 1E1740.7-2942. SIGMA set an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux of from the central supermassive black hole in our Galaxy.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; During the period 1990-1998 SIGMA observed more that one quarter of the sky with sensitivity better than 100 mCrab. The Galactic Center region had the deepest exposure ( approximately 9 million sec), with the sensitivity to a source discovery (S/N &amp;amp;gt; ~ 5) or approximately 10 mCrab.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A list of all detected sources with references to publications on them is presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. 2004, Astr. Lett. v.6. In these survey images (40-100 keV) all performed observations are averaged together. Transient sources that were discovered by SIGMA may not visible in the averaged image. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; This survey has some features that users should keep in mind. The SIGMA telescope is a complicated instrument and is strongly dominated by the accuracy of the background subtraction. The presence of a very bright source in the field of view of the telescope sometimes cannot be fully accounted for and as a result of it some 'ghost' sources can appear. Such features can be seen in the regions near very bright sources like Crab Nebula, Cyg X-1, Nova Per 1992, Nova Mus 1991, Nova Oph 1993, and in the Galactic Center region. In addition to its nominal field of view (~17x17 deg) located around the optical axis of the telescope, SIGMA had another window of relatively high transparency of its shield, approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;#176; apart from the optical axis. Becuase of this a very bright sources like Cyg X-1 can cause non zero illumination of the SIGMA detector if they are located approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;#176; from the optical axis. The ring-like features caused by this effect, can be seen around Cyg X-1, and Nova Per 1992. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The count rate of detected sources (or upper limits) can be roughly translated into mCrab using the fact that that Crab nebula gives the count rate approximately 2.8e&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; cnts/s in the units, provided in 'flux' maps" https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=granat&amp; https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov "NASA/GSFC HEASARC" simpleimageaccess

The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the 'flux' units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-12&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role. Details of the survey are presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al.
