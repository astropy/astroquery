        Parameters
        ----------
        object_name : str
            name of the identifier to query.
        get_query_payload : bool, optional
            This should default to False. When set to `True` the method
            should return the HTTP request parameters as a dict.
        verbose : bool, optional
           This should default to `False`, when set to `True` it displays
           VOTable warnings.
        any_other_param : <param_type>
            similarly list other parameters the method takes

        Returns
        -------
        result : `~astropy.table.Table`
            The result of the query as a `~astropy.table.Table` object.
            All queries other than image queries should typically return
            results like this.

        Examples
        --------
        While this section is optional you may put in some examples that
        show how to use the method. The examples are written similar to
        standard doctests in python.
