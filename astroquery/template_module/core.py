        Parameters
        ----------
        object_name : str
            name of the identifier to query.
        get_query_payload : bool, optional
            This should default to False. When set to `True` the method
            should return the HTTP request parameters as a dict.
        verbose : bool, optional
           This should default to `False`, when set to `True` it displays
           VOTable warnings.
        any_other_param : <param_type>
            similarly list other parameters the method takes

        Returns
        -------
        response : `requests.Response`
            The HTTP response returned from the service.
            All async methods should return the raw HTTP response.

        Examples
        --------
        While this section is optional you may put in some examples that
        show how to use the method. The examples are written similar to
        standard doctests in python.

        # 3. Else make the actual HTTP request and return the corresponding
        #    HTTP response
        # All HTTP requests are made via the `BaseQuery._request` method. This
        # use a generic HTTP request method internally, similar to
        # `requests.Session.request` of the Python Requests library, but
        # with added caching-related tools.

        # first initialize the dictionary of HTTP request parameters
        request_payload = dict()

        # Now fill up the dictionary. Here the dictionary key should match
        # the exact parameter name as expected by the remote server. The
        # corresponding dict value should also be in the same format as
        # expected by the server. Additional parsing of the user passed
        # value may be required to get it in the right units or format.
        # All this parsing may be done in a separate private `_args_to_payload`
        # method for cleaner code.

    #        instead of actually downloading them.
    # 3. extract_image_urls - This takes in the raw HTTP response and scrapes
    #        it to get the downloadable list of image URLs.
    # 4. get_image_list - this is similar to the get_images, but it simply
    #        takes in the list of URLs scrapped by extract_image_urls and
