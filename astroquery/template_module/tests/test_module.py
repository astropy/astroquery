# astroquery uses the pytest framework for testing
# this is already available in astropy and does
# not require a separate install. Import it using:
import pytest

# It would be best if tests are separated in two
# modules. This module performs tests on local data
# by mocking HTTP requests and responses. To test the
# same functions on the remote server, put the relevant
# tests in the 'test_module_remote.py'

# Now import other commonly used modules for tests
import os
import requests

# Local tests should have the corresponding data stored
# in the ./data folder. This is the actual HTTP response
# one would expect from the server when a valid query is made.
# Its best to keep the data file small, so that testing is
# quicker. When running tests locally the stored data is used
# to mock the HTTP requests and response part of the query
# thereby saving time and bypassing unreliability for
# an actual remote network query.

# define a function that can construct the full path to the file in the

    return os.path.join(data_dir, filename)


# define a monkeypatch replacement request function that returns the
# dummy HTTP response for the dummy 'get' function, by
# reading in data from some data file:

    # (you could use them to define which data file to read)

# that mocks(monkeypatches) the actual 'requests.get' function:
