Column meaning:
 
TIME

  Prior to 1962, times are UT1. Dates thereafter are UTC. Any 'b' symbol in
the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank (" ") denotes an A.D.
date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the Julian calendar system.
Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

  Time tags refer to the same instant throughout the solar system, regardless
of where the observer is located. For example, if an observation from the
surface of another body has an output time-tag of 12:31:00 UTC, an Earth-based
time-scale, it refers to the instant on that body simultaneous to 12:31:00 UTC
on Earth.

  The Barycentric Dynamical Time scale (TDB) is used internally as defined by
the planetary equations of motion. Conversion between TDB and the selected
non-uniform UT output time-scale has not been determined for UTC times after
the next July or January 1st. The last known leap-second is used as a constant
over future intervals.

  NOTE: "n.a." in output means quantity "not available" at the print-time.
 
STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES

  Output includes formal +/- 3 standard-deviation statistical orbit uncertainty
quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual value is within given bounds.
These statistical calculations assume observational data errors are random. If
there are systematic biases (such as timing, reduction or star-catalog errors),
results can be optimistic. Because the epoch covariance is mapped using
linearized variational partial derivatives, results can also be optimistic for
times far from the solution epoch, particularly for objects having close
planetary encounters.
 
 R.A._(J2000.0)_DEC. =
   J2000.0 astrometric right ascension and declination of target center.
Adjusted for light-time. Units: DEGREES
 
 dRA*cosD d(DEC)/dt =
    The rate of change of target center apparent RA and DEC (airless).
d(RA)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of the declination.
    Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR
 
 Azi_(a-appr)_Elev =
   Airless apparent azimuth and elevation of target center. Adjusted for
light-time, the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration,
precession and nutation. Azimuth measured North(0) -> East(90) -> South(180) ->
West(270) -> North (360). Elevation is with respect to plane perpendicular
to local zenith direction.  TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units: DEGREES
 
 a-mass mag_ex=
    RELATIVE optical airmass and visual magnitude extinction. Airmass is the
ratio between the absolute optical airmass for the target's refracted CENTER
point to the absolute optical airmass at zenith. Also output is the estimated
visual magnitude extinction due to the atmosphere, as seen by the observer.
AVAILABLE ONLY FOR TOPOCENTRIC EARTH SITES WHEN THE TARGET IS ABOVE THE HORIZON
Units: None (airmass) and magnitudes (extinction).
 
 APmag S-brt =
   Asteroid's approximate apparent visual magnitude & surface brightness:
   APmag = H + 5*log10(delta) + 5*log10(r) - 2.5*log10((1-G)*phi1 + G*phi2)
For solar phase angles > 90 deg, the error could exceed 1 magnitude. For
phase angles > 120 degrees, output values are rounded to the nearest integer
to indicate the errors could be large and unknown.
   Units: NONE & VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND
 
 Illu% =
   Fraction of target circular disk illuminated by Sun (phase), as seen by
observer.  Units: PERCENT
 
 hEcl-Lon hEcl-Lat =
    Geometric heliocentric J2000 ecliptic longitude and latitude of target
center at the instant light leaves it to be observed at print time (print time
minus 1-way light-time).  Units: DEGREES
 
 r       rdot =
   Heliocentric range ("r", light-time corrected) and range-rate ("rdot")
of the target center at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time
would have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time).
The Sun-to-target distance traveled by a ray of light emanating from the
center of the Sun that reaches the target center point at some instant and
is recordable by the observer one down-leg light-time later at print-time.
Units: AU and KM/S
 
 delta  deldot =
   Range ("delta") and range-rate ("delta-dot") of target center with respect
to the observer at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time would
have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time); the
distance traveled by a light ray emanating from the center of the target and
recorded by the observer at print-time. "deldot" is a projection of the
velocity vector along this ray, the light-time-corrected line-of-sight from the
coordinate center, and indicates relative motion. A positive "deldot" means the
target center is moving away from the observer (coordinate center). A negative
"deldot" means the target center is moving toward the observer.
Units: AU and KM/S
 
 1-way_LT =
   1-way down-leg light-time from target center to observer. The elapsed time
since light (observed at print-time) would have left or reflected off a point
at the center of the target. Units: MINUTES
 
 S-O-T /r =
    Sun-Observer-Target angle; target's apparent SOLAR ELONGATION seen from
the observer location at print-time. Angular units: DEGREES

    The '/r' column indicates the target's apparent position relative to
the Sun in the observer's sky, as described below:

    For an observing location on the surface of a rotating body
(considering its rotational sense):

    /T indicates target TRAILS Sun (evening sky; rises and sets AFTER Sun)
    /L indicates target LEADS Sun  (morning sky; rises and sets BEFORE Sun)

For an observing point NOT on a rotating body (such as a spacecraft), the
"leading" and "trailing" condition is defined by the observer's
heliocentric orbital motion: if continuing in the observer's current
direction of heliocentric motion would encounter the target's apparent
longitude first, followed by the Sun's, the target LEADS the Sun as seen by
the observer. If the Sun's apparent longitude would be encountered first,
followed by the target's, the target TRAILS the Sun.

NOTE: The S-O-T solar elongation angle is numerically the minimum
separation angle of the Sun and target in the sky in any direction. It
does NOT indicate the amount of separation in the leading or trailing
directions, which are defined in the equator of a spherical coordinate
system.
 
 S-T-O =
   "S-T-O" is the Sun->Target->Observer angle; the interior vertex angle at
target center formed by a vector to the apparent center of the Sun at
reflection time on the target and the apparent vector to the observer at
print-time. Slightly different from true PHASE ANGLE (requestable separately)
at the few arcsecond level in that it includes stellar aberration on the
down-leg from target to observer.  Units: DEGREES
 
 PsAng PsAMV =
   The position angles of the extended Sun->target radius vector ("PsAng")
and the negative of the target's heliocentric velocity vector ("PsAMV"),
as seen in the observer's plane-of-sky, measured CCW (east) from reference
frame North Celestial Pole. Primarily intended for ACTIVE COMETS, "PsAng"
is an indicator of the comet's gas-tail orientation in the sky (being in
the anti-sunward direction) while "PsAMV" is an indicator of dust-tail
orientation.
   Units: DEGREES
 
 ObsEcLon ObsEcLat =
   Observer-centered Earth ecliptic-of-date longitude and latitude of the
target center's apparent position, adjusted for light-time, the gravitational
deflection of light and stellar aberration. Although centered on the observer,
the values are expressed relative to coordinate basis directions defined by
the Earth's true equator-plane, equinox direction, and mean ecliptic plane at
print time.  Units: DEGREES
 
 GlxLon GlxLat =
   Observer-centered Galactic System II (post WW II) longitude and latitude
of the target center's apparent position. Adjusted for light-time,
gravitational deflection of light, and stellar aberration. Units: DEG DEG
 
 RA_3sigma DEC_3sigma =
  Uncertainty in Right-Ascension and Declination. Output values are the formal
+/- 3 standard-deviations (sigmas) around nominal position. Units: ARCSECONDS
