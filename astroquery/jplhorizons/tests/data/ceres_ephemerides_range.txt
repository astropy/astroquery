Column meaning:
 
TIME

  Times PRIOR to 1962 are UT1, a mean-solar time closely related to the
prior but now-deprecated GMT. Times AFTER 1962 are in UTC, the current
civil or "wall-clock" time-scale. UTC is kept within 0.9 seconds of UT1
using integer leap-seconds for 1972 and later years.

  Conversion from the internal Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) of solar
system dynamics to the non-uniform civil UT time-scale requested for output
has not been determined for UTC times after the next July or January 1st.
Therefore, the last known leap-second is used as a constant over future
intervals.

  Time tags refer to the UT time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth
regardless of observer location within the solar system, although clock
rates may differ due to the local gravity field and no analog to "UT"
may be defined for that location.

  Any 'b' symbol in the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank
(" ") denotes an A.D. date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the
Julian calendar system. Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

  NOTE: "n.a." in output means quantity "not available" at the print-time.
 
STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES

  Output includes formal +/- 3 standard-deviation statistical orbit uncertainty
quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual value is within given bounds.
These statistical calculations assume observational data errors are random. If
there are systematic biases (such as timing, reduction or star-catalog errors),
results can be optimistic. Because the epoch covariance is mapped using
linearized variational partial derivatives, results can also be optimistic for
times far from the solution epoch, particularly for objects having close
planetary encounters.
 
 'R.A._(ICRF), DEC_(ICRF),' =
  Astrometric right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to the observing site (coordinate origin) in the reference frame of
the planetary ephemeris (ICRF). Compensated for down-leg light-time delay
aberration.

  Units: RA  in decimal degrees,  ddd.fffff{ffff}
         DEC in decimal degrees,  sdd.fffff{ffff}
 
 'R.A._(a-app), DEC_(a-app),' =
  Airless apparent right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to an instantaneous reference frame defined by the Earth equator of-dat
(z-axis) and meridian containing the Earth equinox of-date (x-axis, EOP-correct
IAU76/80). Compensated for down-leg light-time delay, gravitational deflection
of light, stellar aberration, precession & nutation. Note: equinox (RA origin)
is offset -53 mas from the of-date frame defined by the IAU06/00a P & N system.

  Units: RA  in decimal degrees, ddd.fffff{ffff}
         DEC in decimal degrees  sdd.fffff{ffff}

 
 'dRA*cosD, d(DEC)/dt,' =
  The angular rate of change in aparent RA and DEC of the target. This is
with respect to the non-inertial IAU76/80 Earth true equator and equinox
of-date reference frame.  d(RA)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of declination
to provide a linear rate in the plane-of-sky. Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR
 
 'Azi_(a-app), Elev_(a-app),' =
  Airless apparent azimuth and elevation of target center. Compensated
for light-time, the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration,
precession and nutation. Azimuth is measured clockwise from north:

  North(0) -> East(90) -> South(180) -> West(270) -> North (360)

Elevation angle is with respect to a plane perpendicular to the reference
surface local zenith direction. TOPOCENTRIC ONLY.  Units: DEGREES
 
 'dAZ*cosE, d(ELV)/dt,' =
   The rate of change of target center apparent azimuth and elevation
(airless). d(AZ)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of the elevation angle.
TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units: ARCSECOND PER MINUTE
 
 'X_(sat-prim), Y_(sat-prim), SatPANG,' =
   Satellite apparent differential coordinates in the plane-of-sky with
respect to the primary body along with the satellite position angle.
Differential coordinates are defined in RA as:

     X= ((RA_sat - RA_primary) * cosine(DEC_primary))

... and in DEC as:

     Y= (DEC_sat - DEC_primary)

Non-lunar satellites only. "SatPANG" is the counter-clockwise (CCW) position
angle from the reference-frame of-date north-pole to a line from the primary
center to the satellite center. Units: ARCSECONDS (X & Y), DEGREES (pos, angle)
 
 'L_Ap_Sid_Time,' =
   Local Apparent Sidereal Time. The angle measured westward in the body
true-equator of-date plane from the meridian containing the body-fixed
observer to the meridian containing the true Earth equinox (defined by
intersection of the true Earth equator of date with the ecliptic of date).
TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units: HH.fffffffffff  (decimal hours)
 
 'a-mass, mag_ex,' =
    RELATIVE optical airmass and visual magnitude extinction. Airmass is the
ratio between the absolute optical airmass for the targets' refracted CENTER
point to the absolute optical airmass at zenith. Also output is the estimated
visual magnitude extinction due to the atmosphere, as seen by the observer.
AVAILABLE ONLY FOR TOPOCENTRIC EARTH SITES WHEN THE TARGET IS ABOVE THE
HORIZON.  Units: none (airmass) and magnitudes (extinction).
 
 'APmag,  S-brt,' =
   The asteroids' approximate apparent airless visual magnitude and surface
brightness using the standard IAU H-G system magnitude model:

   APmag = H + 5*log10(delta) + 5*log10(r) - 2.5*log10((1-G)*phi_1 + G*phi_2)

   For solar phase angles >90 deg, the error could exceed 1 magnitude. For
phase angles >120 degrees, output values are rounded to the nearest integer to
indicate error could be large and unknown. For Earth-based observers, the
estimated dimming due to atmospheric absorption (extinction) is available as
a separate, requestable quantity.

   Surface brightness is the average airless visual magnitude of a
square-arcsecond of the illuminated portion of the apparent disk. It is
computed only if the target radius is known.

   Units: MAGNITUDES & MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND

  The angular separation between the center of the target object and the center
of the (remote) primary body it revolves around, as seen by the observer, with
target visibility code. The observer cannot be on the primary body.

  Visibility codes (refers to limb-to-limb):

    /t = Transiting primary body disk    /O = Occulted by primary body disk
    /p = Partial umbral eclipse          /P = Occulted partial umbral eclipse
    /u = Total umbral eclipse            /U = Occulted total umbral eclipse
    /- = Target is the primary body      /* = None of above ("free and clear")

  The radius of both primary and target body is taken to be the equatorial
value (maximum, given a triaxial shape). Atmospheric effects and oblateness
aspect are NOT currently considered.  Light-time is considered.

  Units: ARCSECONDS and visibility code
 
 'Ang-diam,' =
   The equatorial angular width of the target body full disk, if it were fully
illuminated and visible to the observer. If the target body diameter is unknown
"n.a." is output.

   Units: ARCSECONDS
 
 'ObsSub-LON, ObsSub-LAT,' =
   Apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target
disc seen by the OBSERVER at print-time. This is NOT exactly the same as the
"nearest" sub-point for a non-spherical target shape (since the center of
the disc might not be the point closest to the observer), but is generally
very close if not a very irregular body shape. Down-leg light travel-time
from target to observer is taken into account. Latitude is the angle between
the equatorial plane and the line perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid of
the body, so includes body oblateness. The reference ellipsoid is an oblate
spheroid with a single flatness coefficient in which the y-axis body radius
is taken to be the same value as the x-axis radius. Positive longitude is to
the WEST for this target. Cartographic system is given in the header.
   Units: DEGREES DEGREES
 
 'SunSub-LON, SunSub-LAT,' =
   Apparent sub-solar longitude and latitude of the Sun on the target. The
apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target disc
as seen from the Sun, as seen by the observer at print-time. This is NOT
exactly the same as the "sub-solar" (nearest) point for a non-spherical target
shape (since the center of the disc seen from the Sun might not be the closest
point to the Sun), but is very close if not a highly irregular body shape.
Light travel-time from Sun to target and from target to observer is taken into
account.  Latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the line
perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid of the body. The reference ellipsoid
is an oblate spheroid with a single flatness coefficient in which the y-axis
body radius is taken to be the same value as the x-axis radius.  Positive
longitude is to the WEST for this target. Cartographic system is given in the
header.   Units: DEGREES DEGREES
 
 'SN.ang,  SN.dist,' =
  Targets' apparent sub-solar point position angle (counter-clockwise with
respect to the direction of the true-of-date reference-frame north-pole) and
its angular distance from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at print
time. A negative distance indicates the sub-solar point is on the hidden
hemisphere.  Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS
 
 'NP.ang,  NP.dist,' =
  Targets' apparent north-pole position angle (counter-clockwise with respect
to the direction of the true-of-date reference-frame north-pole) and its
angular distance from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at observation
time.  A negative distance indicates the planets' north-pole is on the hidden
hemisphere.  Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS
 
 'hEcl-Lon,hEcl-Lat,' =
    Geometric heliocentric J2000 ecliptic longitude and latitude of target
center at the instant light leaves it to be observed at print time (print time

the Sun.  Units: AU and KM/S
 
 'delta,     deldot,' =
   Apparent range ("delta", light-time aberrated) and range-rate ("delta-dot")
of the target center relative to the observer. A positive "deldot" means the
target center is moving away from the observer, negative indicates movement
toward the observer.  Units: AU and KM/S
 
 '1-way_down_LT,' =
   1-way down-leg light-time from target center to observer. The elapsed time
since light (observed at print-time) would have left or reflected off a point
at the center of the target. Units: MINUTES
 
 'VmagSn,     VmagOb,' =
   Magnitude of target centers' velocity with respect to the Sun ("VmagSn")
and the observer ("VmagOb") at the time light left the target center to be
observed (print time minus down-leg light-time). These are absolute values
of the velocity vectors (total speeds) and do NOT indicate direction of motion.
Units: KM/S
 
 'S-O-T,/r,' =
   Sun-Observer-Target apparent SOLAR ELONGATION ANGLE seen from the observers'
location at print-time.

   The '/r' column provides a code indicating the targets' apparent position
relative to the Sun in the observers' sky, as described below:

   Case A: For an observing location on the surface of a rotating body, that
body rotational sense is considered:

    /T indicates target TRAILS Sun   (evening sky: rises and sets AFTER Sun)
    /L indicates target LEADS Sun    (morning sky: rises and sets BEFORE Sun)

   Case B: For an observing point that does not have a rotational model (such
as a spacecraft), the "leading" and "trailing" condition is defined by the
observers' heliocentric ORBITAL motion:

    * If continuing in the observers' current direction of heliocentric
       motion would encounter the targets' apparent longitude first, followed
       by the Sun's, the target LEADS the Sun as seen by the observer.

    * If the Sun's apparent longitude would be encountered first, followed
       by the targets', the target TRAILS the Sun.

   Two other codes can be output:
    /* indicates observer is Sun-centered    (undefined)
    /? Target is aligned with Sun center     (no lead or trail)

   The S-O-T solar elongation angle is numerically the minimum separation
angle of the Sun and target in the sky in any direction. It does NOT indicate
the amount of separation in the leading or trailing directions, which would
be defined along the equator of a spherical coordinate system.

   Units: DEGREES
 
 'S-T-O,' =
   The Sun-Target-Observer angle; the interior vertex angle at target center

   Difference between the uniform Barycentric Dynamical time-scale and the
Earth-rotation dependent Universal Time. Prior to 1962, the difference is with
respect to UT1 (TDB-UT1) and the 0.002 second maximum amplitude distinction
between TT and TDB is not maintained. For 1962 and later, the difference is
with respect to UTC (TDB-UTC) and periodic terms less than 1.e-6 second are
ignored. Values beyond the next July or January 1st may change if a leap-second
is later required by the IERS. Values from the present date forward through

the angle in the targets' instantaneous orbit plane from the orbital periapse
direction to the target, measured positively in the direction of motion.
