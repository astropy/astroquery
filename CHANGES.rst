===================

New Tools and Services
----------------------



API changes
-----------

  response any more. [#3278]

Service fixes and enhancements
------------------------------

  be increased (with the ``timeout`` property or with the configuration file) [#3305]

skyview
^^^^^^^


- Added ``get_query_payload`` kwarg to ``Skyview.get_images()`` and ``Skyview.get_images_list()``
  to return the query payload [#3318]

utils.tap
^^^^^^^^^

- Get the cookie associated to the keys JSESSIONID or SESSION due to the tap library release at ESAC. [#3289]

- The method ``upload_table`` accepts file formats accepted by astropy's
  ``Table.read()``. [#3295]

- Added ``return_uri_map`` parameter to ``Observations.get_cloud_uris`` to return a mapping of the input data product URIs
  to the returned cloud URIs. [#3314]

- Added ``verbose`` parameter to ``Observations.get_cloud_uris`` to control whether warnings are logged when a product cannot
  be found in the cloud. [#3314]

- Improved ``MastMissions`` queries to accept lists for query critieria values, in addition to comma-delimited strings. [#3319]


Infrastructure, Utility and Other Changes and Additions
-------------------------------------------------------

  ``MOCServer.query_region`` to allow temporal and space-time searches. [#3139]

- ``return_moc`` now allows to ask for a Time-MOC or a Space-Time MOC rather
  than only Space-MOCs. [#3139]

- Fix query by MOC that would write a file ``moc.fits`` where the method

- For the functions that return files in FITS/ECSV format, the files are now
  provided as uncompressed files. [#2983]

- New parameter USE_NAMES_OVER_IDS that gives preference to ``name`` over ID
  attributes of columns as the names of columns in the ``astropy.table.Table``
  instance. By default, value True is set, that gives name preference. [#2967]

- Change the signature of the method ``load_data``: the parameter
  ``output_file`` that defined the file where the results were
  saved, is replaced by boolean parameter ``dump_to_file``, that in case it
  is true, a compressed directory named "datalink_output.zip" with
  all the DataLink files is made. So the users cannot specified the output
  file anymore.  [#3014]

- New retrieval types for datalink (Gaia DR4 release). [#3110]

  ``MPC.get_observatory_codes`` without deprecation as the parameters were
  ignored and had no effect. [#3089]

- Fixed bug in ``MPC.get_ephemeris`` that caused the ``cache`` keyword parameter
  to be ignored. [#3089]

- ``query_bibcode`` output is now in an astropy Table with distinct columns
  instead of a single one in which all the information was a string. [#2954]

- ``query_criteria`` is now deprecated and should be replaced by either custom
  TAP queries or by the ``criteria`` argument added in the other query methods.
  A helper method was added ``astroquery.simbad.utils.CriteriaTranslator`` to
  translate between the sim-script syntax and the TAP/ADQL syntax. [#2954]

- Fixed ``query_objects`` that would not work in combination with the
  additional field ``ident``. [#3149]

  children, or siblings of an object. [#3175]

- Added ``NoResultsWarning`` when a query returns an empty table. [#3068]

skyview
^^^^^^^

- Overlay arguments ``lut``, ``grid``, and ``gridlabel`` are removed, as they
  only apply to output types not returned by Astroquery. [#2979]

- Query ``id_type`` behavior has changed:
    * ``'majorbody'`` and ``'id'`` have been removed and the equivalent

      small body search when no matches are found. Horizons does not have a
      major body only search. [#2161]
