0.4.2 (unreleased)
==================

Service fixes and enhancements
------------------------------

esa/hubble

Service fixes and enhancements
------------------------------

alma
^^^^

- A new API was deployed in late February / early March 2020, requiring a
  refactor.  The user-facing API should remain mostly the same, but some
  service interruption may have occurred.  Note that the ``stage_data`` column
  ``uid`` has been renamed ``mous_uid``, which is a technical correction, and
  several columns have been added. [#1644, #1665, #1683]

- The contents of tarfiles can be shown with the ``expand_tarfiles`` keyword
  to ``stage_data``. [#1683]

- Bugfix: when accessing private data, auth credentials were not being passed
  to the HEAD request used to acquire header data. [#1698]

casda
^^^^^

- Add ability to stage and download ASKAP data. [#1706]

cadc
^^^^

- Fixed authentication and enabled listing of async jobs. [#1712]

eso
^^^

- New ``unzip`` parameter to control uncompressing the retrieved data. [#1642]

^^^^

- Allow for setting row limits in query submissions through class
  attribute. [#1641]

^^^^^^

  the raw web query against the Gemini Archive. [#1659]

jplhorizons
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix for changes in HORIZONS return results after their 2020 Feb 12
  update. [#1650]

nasa_exoplanet_archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Update the NASA Exoplanet Archive interface to support all tables available
  through the API. The standard astroquery interface is now implemented via the
  ``query_*[_async]`` methods. [#1700]

nrao
^^^^

- Fixed passing ``project_code`` to the query [#1720]

vizier
^^^^^^

- It is now possible to specify constraints to ``query_region()``
  with the ``column_filters`` keyword. [#1702]


Infrastructure, Utility and Other Changes and Additions
-------------------------------------------------------

- Versions of astropy <3.1 are no longer supported. [#1649]

- Fixed a bug that would prevent the TOP statement from being properly added
  to a TAP query containing valid '\n'. The bug was revealed by changes to
  the gaia module, introduced in version 0.4. [#1680]

- Added new ``json`` keyword to BaseQuery requests. [#1657]


0.4 (2020-01-24)
================

New Tools and Services
----------------------

casda
^^^^^

- Module added to access data from the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive.  [#1505]

mast
^^^^

- Add Kepler to missions with cloud support,
  Update ``get_cloud_uri`` so that if a file is not found it produces a warning
  and returns None rather than throwing an exception. [#1561]

nasa_exoplanet_archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Redefined the query API so as to prevent downloading of the whole database.
  Added two functions ``query_planet`` (to query for a specific exoplanet), and
  ``query_star`` (to query for all exoplanets under a specific stellar system) [#1606]



splatalogue
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added new 'only_astronomically_observed' option. [#1600]

vo_conesearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``query_region()`` now accepts ``service_url`` keyword and uses
  ``conf.pedantic`` and ``conf.timeout`` directly. As a result, ``URL``,
  ``PEDANTIC``, and ``TIMEOUT`` class attributes are no longer needed, so
  they are removed from ``ConeSearchClass`` and ``ConeSearch``. [#1528]

- The classic API ``conesearch()`` no longer takes ``timeout`` and ``pedantic``
  keywords. It uses ``conf.pedantic`` and ``conf.timeout`` directly. [#1528]

  new hashes.  You should clear your cache: for most users, that means
