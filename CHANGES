0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Bugfix for ``utils.commons.send_request()``: Raise exception if error status
  is returned in the response. (#491)

0.2.3 (2014-09-30)
------------------


- AstroResponse has been removed, which means that all cached objects will have
  new hashes.  You should clear your cache: for most users, that means
  ``rm -r ~/.astropy/cache/astroquery/`` (#418)
- In ESO and ALMA, default to *not* storing your password.  New keyword
  ``store_password=False``.  (#415)
- In ESO, fixed a form activation issue triggered in ESO ``retrieve_data()``,
  updated file download link triggered by server side change.
  More interesting, made ``username`` optional in ``login()``:
  instead, you can now configure your preferred ``username``.
  Finally, automatic login is now used by ``retrieve_data()``, if configured. (#420, #427)
- Bugfix for UKIDSS: Login now uses the correct session to retrieve the data
  (#425)
- ALMA - many new features, including selective file retrieval.  Fixes many errors that
  were unnoticed in the previous version (#433)
- ALMA - add ``help`` method and pass payload keywords on correctly.  Validate
  the payload before querying. (#438)
